# pygame-snake
use pygame to develop a snake game

## Basic Rules
### Boundaries
u die when snake touches the boundaries of the game screen

### Obstacles
u die when snake touches the obstacle (blue rectangle)

### Food
when snake eats it, snake grows longer (for 1 grid) and snake's movement becomes a little bit faster

### Slowpill
when snake eats it, snake's speed set back to default (at least for now)
